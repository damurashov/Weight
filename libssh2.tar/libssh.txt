Libraries have been installed in:
   /net/metis/home/faculty/mfukuda/MASS/c++/ssh2/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

Compile MASS by make on one of uw1-320-16 through to 22 or mnode0 through to 17. This is because they are 32-bit RedHat Linux, whereas Hercules is 64-bit RedHat and uw1-320-00~15 are 64-bit Ubutu.
